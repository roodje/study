# Software development lifecycle

When developing software, you usually do this for a client or a customer, together with other engineers. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software. There are different phases in the software development that when finished will result in working software. The SDLC describes different phases with an ordering of the phases, each phase produces deliverables required by the next phase. It’s important to understand the different stages as it allows you to make a step from local engineering on your laptop to working in a team with others. This chapter will break down the different stages and roles and responsibilities involved.

There are 6 cycles for the development lifecycle that are important to distinguish. Some SDLC’s have one or two phases more but the overall concept remains the same, hence why we are only focusing on the following 6.

1.	Requirements
2.	Software design (or architecture)
3.	Development
4.	Testing
5.	Deployment
6.	Review

## Requirements gathering

•	**Background**: The requirement is the first stage in the SDLC process. In order to built new software as an engineer you need to make sure you built what a customer actually wants to use. Most software developing firms agree that the first phase of the process begins by identifying a need. This  requirement is a wish from a customer that needs to be built. It’s usually the job of a Product manager / Product owner to define the requirements.

•	**Output of this phase**: a list of requirements that make up the project. Requirements can contain a design of how the application should look like. Which buttons are on the page, what collor, what is the behaviour of the application etc.

•	**Role(s) involved**: A product owner or project manager (the roles will be explained later)

## Software Design

**Background**: Software design is not to be misunderstood for the design of the application (look and feel). In software design the requirements from the previous phase are input for this phase in order to come up with a software design or a software architecture. This design outlines the software’s architecture and specify the technologies used in its development. Depending on the size and complexity of the software design, the process is usually performed by architects or senior engineers. A design can involve a part of a complex system (like a bank) or can be the design of a small application developed by 2 engineers.

Questions typically answered in this phase are. 

-	What tool or technology is most suited for the job:
o	Does the system needs to be high available
o	Will there be a high load on the system (a lot of concurrent user)?
o	What data storage do we need to select
-	What tools do we have available in the company
o	Some tools (like databases) come with high licenses costs, 
o	Not all teams can decide themselves what they want to use
o	The design needs to make sure the software can be supported and operated within the organization’s constraints
-	How do the different components communicate
o	In a complex system there are multiple applications communicating with each other to complete a business process
o	What data format will be used
